    A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.
    55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.
    The usually deep purple roots of <em>beetroot</em> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.
